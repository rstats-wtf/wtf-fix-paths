# wtf-fix-paths

* This project contains some code files that use data in the `data/` directory
* For scripts `R/01_absolute_paths.R` and `02_relative_paths.R`, run the code as-is and note any errors you encounter.
  * Then, follow the instructions in the code comments to fix the code.
* Read the contents of `R/03_report.Rmd` and predict what you think the code will return.
  * Then click the "knit" button and see if you were right!
