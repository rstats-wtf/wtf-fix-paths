```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an R Markdown file. It contains text (which you are reading), as well as R code.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

Before you knit the document, write down your predictions of what the following code will return:

```{r check-wd}
getwd()
```

```{r change-wd}
setwd("..") # .. means "one folder up from wherever I am"
getwd()
```

```{r check-again}
getwd()
```
